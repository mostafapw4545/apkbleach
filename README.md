# apkbleach
This BASH script will remove the obvious fingerprints of metasploit through out a given apk file. It also gives the option to inject a custom app icon. This script is constantly being improved so revisions will be made frequently. This is the PUBLIC version of this script thats only triggers 12 of 60 anti-viruses. When the metasploit payload generated by msfvenom with out this script triggers 28 of 60. I am always looking for feed back and ways to improve the code and its techniques. Please feel free to contribute or contact me at graylagx2@gmail.com

! It is highly recomended to let the script generate the payload with nops
   
Usage: 

         Usage: apkbleach -g <android/payload/to/use LHOST=ip-address-to-use LPORT=port-to-use> -i <path/to/image.png> -o  <path/to/outputname.apk>

      -g <android/payload/to/use LHOST=ip-address-to-use LPORT=port-to-use>
          Generates obfuscated payload with nops
  
      -i <path/to/image.png> [ use -i --list ] to list defaults
